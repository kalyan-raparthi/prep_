### 1. Language Core (the grammar of thought)

* JVM, JRE, JDK (execution vs tooling)
* Primitive types, references, memory model
* Control flow, expressions, scope
* `String` immutability, pooling
* `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`

**Insight:** Java is not “object-oriented”; it is *object-centric with strict memory semantics*. Many bugs are memory-model misunderstandings disguised as logic errors.

---

### 2. Object Model (how Java thinks about identity)

* Classes, objects, constructors
* Inheritance vs composition
* Interfaces, default methods
* `final`, immutability patterns
* Records (data-first modeling)

**Insight:** Prefer *behavioral boundaries* (interfaces) over *hierarchies*. Deep inheritance is a code smell, not elegance.

---

### 3. Type System (Java’s real power)

* Generics (invariance, wildcards)
* Type erasure
* Bounded types
* PECS (`Producer extends, Consumer super`)
* Sealed classes

**Insight:** Java’s type system is *compile-time constraint programming*. Mastery here reduces runtime bugs dramatically.

---

### 4. Collections & Data Structures

* `List`, `Set`, `Map` internals
* ArrayList vs LinkedList
* HashMap internals (hashing, tree bins)
* Immutable collections
* `Comparator` vs `Comparable`

**Insight:** Performance problems often come from *wrong container choice*, not algorithms.

---

### 5. Exceptions & Error Semantics

* Checked vs unchecked
* Exception hierarchy
* Try-with-resources
* Designing failure paths

**Insight:** Exceptions are *control-flow with moral weight*. Abuse them and systems rot silently.

---

### 6. Functional Java

* Lambdas
* Method references
* Streams (lazy evaluation)
* Collectors
* Optional (correct use)

**Insight:** Streams are not “faster loops”; they are *declarative pipelines*. Misuse leads to unreadable slowness.

---

### 7. Concurrency & Parallelism

* Threads vs Executors
* Synchronization, locks
* `volatile`, happens-before
* Concurrent collections
* CompletableFuture
* Virtual Threads (Project Loom)

**Insight:** Concurrency bugs are *epistemic bugs*—you think something is true when it isn’t.

---

### 8. JVM Internals (where mastery begins)

* Stack vs heap
* GC algorithms (G1, ZGC)
* JIT compilation
* Escape analysis
* Memory leaks in “GC languages”

**Insight:** Java performance tuning is mostly *allocation discipline*, not micro-optimizations.

---

### 9. I/O, Networking, Files

* NIO, Channels, Buffers
* Blocking vs non-blocking I/O
* Serialization pitfalls
* HTTP clients

**Insight:** I/O dominates latency. CPU optimization is often irrelevant.

---

### 10. Tooling & Ecosystem

* Maven vs Gradle
* JUnit, Mockito
* Logging (SLF4J, Logback)
* Profilers (JFR, VisualVM)
* Build reproducibility

**Insight:** Real-world Java is *tooling-heavy*. Code quality without tooling is an illusion.

---

### 11. Framework Layer (optional but practical)

* Spring (DI, AOP, Boot)
* JPA/Hibernate (ORM reality)
* Reactive stacks (WebFlux)
* Microservices tradeoffs

**Insight:** Frameworks amplify both good and bad design. They don’t save bad thinking.

---

### 12. Advanced & Research Directions

* JVM languages (Kotlin, Scala)
* GraalVM, native images
* Java in high-frequency trading
* Distributed systems on JVM
* Formal verification & static analysis

**Insight:** Java survives because the JVM is a *computational ecosystem*, not a language.

---

## How mastery actually happens

* Read source code (JDK, HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap)
* Break things intentionally
* Measure before believing
* Prefer mental models over memorization
